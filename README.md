## Why Nord Jujoco?

Every subtle detail in this theme is crafted to reduce cognitive load and keep you immersed in your work. The cohesive and intentional color palette ensures clarity and consistency across your codebase, allowing you to write and review code with ease.

Hereâ€™s how the nuanced color scheme makes a difference:

- **Parameters** are styled in *italics* for a subtle yet effective distinction.
- **Reserved keywords** share a calm cool blue tone, blending seamlessly into the background to avoid unnecessary distractions.
- **Methods and function calls** stand out with a yellow pastel tone, making them easy to identify at a glance.
- **Variables** remain crisp and clean in white, keeping your code visually organized.
- **Strings** carry a warm orange tone, adding contrast without overwhelming the viewer.
- **Classes and type definitions** are highlighted with a teal tone to signify their importance without being overbearing.
- **Number Primitives** use a classic leaf green tone, helping you quickly spot them in your logic.

These deliberate choices create a harmonious and focused environment where all the small nuances work together to minimize distractions and enhance your productivity.
